This is a senior project for the ASU Software Engineering program.
We designed an Android app for an insurance company that allows its members to suggest buisness ideas and have them rated by their fellow members. Employees approve the ideas and they are then added to a board. These ideas are voted on and ultimatly can be chosen by the company to use.
